Specific goals are to collaborate ideas to make life easier on all walks of life. \n\nIn April of 2014, I faced a serious health challenge. That challenge became the major turning point in my life. I retired from my 15 year career as a fire fighter, at the age of 35, to lead a team of talented developers, engineers, and staff. It was one of the hardest choices I've ever made, but wouldn't change it for a minute. \n\nI am now extremely fortunate to lead the team at FireWhat as the CEO and President of the Board. Our team is dedicated to creating the best possible geospatial solutions for Natural Resource Management. Through our strategic alignments in the Emergency Incident, and Agricultural Water Management sectors, our team is positioned for rapid market adoption.  \n\nVisit our site to learn more:\n\nwww.firewhat.com","headline":"President, CEO, and Co-Founder","skills":[],"parents":[]},"communities":["bend-or","bendtech","ShastaAngels","redding-ca"]},

Our mission is to support and grow early stage entrepreneurship in Lane County. \n\nWe are a grassroots organization built by founders for founders. FertiLab was the first Hub of entrepreneurship in Eugene and we were a driver in kickstarting the local startup ecosystem. \n\nOur support for startups includes a physical incubator for tech and biotech companies (we have a biotech lab space), mentorship, a structured pre-accelerator program, community educational programming, and access to micro seed funding. We also work closely with RAIN Eugene to help energize the entrepreneurial community and to create a pipeline of startups for their accelerator.","title":"Co-Founder and Executive Director"}]},"publicProfileUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shulajaron","summary":"R&D manager experienced in leading large multidisciplinary programs, interested in gaining experience in business management","access_token":"AQXqktJUnAsUZXayERF6-0L03B7r8apOmwg7FpbWDfffzR2p1-1-l-_lgfGf3SRIi3mx5G9eF9zd5BcT4zBgrlp4bRPSItbcyvjN7UhUOitNflTv4PoycX-hWlwwsQbr-oFCGPNyHkGjlvQumNzqF-8P4cDZ88GpuwUTyvDM7JWrObv5Wx0"},"avatar":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mprx/0_LNotM7Ghcb7NpkUiLBd3M2K_R6ZnYkwibvODMD-gXiuQThy_WtVYcSQPze4Wj_EfXBHunEuvkDB8","name":"Shula Jaron","headline":"Co-Founder and Executive Director at FertiLab Thinkubator","summary":"Executive Director of an organization leading the change toward innovation and entrepreneurship as a strong driver of local economic growth.","skills":["Biotechnology","New Product Development","Business Development","Entrepreneurship","Science","Business Management","Program Management"],"parents":["tech"]},"communities":["eugene-or"],"roles":{"founder":{"eugene-or":["eugene-or"]},"mentor":{"eugene-or":["eugene-or"]}}},

All OVERFUND projects begin with predetermined key performance indicators (KPI's), timelines, action items and checkpoints. This ensures focus throughout a project and that expectations on both sides are always clear. WE CREATE MOVEMENTS, NOT CAMPAIGNS\n\nIn order to achieve massive success in crowdfunding and have a shot at OVERFUNDING a campaign, a project must \"go viral\". For this to occur, a project must be developed to carry with it a message that extends far beyond the project itself. Otherwise, the project will never be able to capitalize on the momentum social networks, digital marketing and a crowdfunding platform can provide. Simply stated, at OVERFUND, we help individuals and organizations develop MOVEMENT MESSAGING, not campaign messaging.","title":"President and Co-Founder"},{"company":{"name":"Occupy - Erase Recession, Fund Your Dreams, Change the World"},"id":309503532,"isCurrent":true,"startDate":{"month":3,"year":2012},"summary":"OCCUPY opens with the root cause of recession and what it means followed by the formula for transformational change and the good news of HOPE.
