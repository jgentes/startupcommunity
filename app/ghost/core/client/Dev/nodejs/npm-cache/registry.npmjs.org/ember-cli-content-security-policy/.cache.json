ember-cli-content-security-policy\n\nThis addon makes it easy to use Content Security Policy (CSP) in your project. It can be deployed either\nvia a `Content-Security-Policy` header sent from the Ember CLI Express server, or as a meta tag in the\n`index.html` file.\n\nWhen using the header, configuration is still needed on the production server (Ember CLI's express server \nis not intended for production use). When using the meta tag this addon can be used for production deployment.\nIn any case, using this addon helps keeping CSP in the forefront of your thoughts while developing an Ember application.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nember install ember-cli-content-security-policy\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThis addon is configured via your applications `config/environment.js` file. Two specific properties are\nused from your projects configuration:\n\n* `contentSecurityPolicyHeader` -- The header to use for CSP. There are two options:\n  - `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` This is the default and means nothing is actually blocked but you get warnings in the console.\n  - `Content-Security-Policy` This makes the browser block any action that conflicts with the Content Security Policy.\n\n* `contentSecurityPolicy` -- This is an object that is used to build the final header value. Each key/value\n  in this object is converted into a key/value pair in the resulting header value.\n\n* `contentSecurityPolicyMeta` -- Boolean. Toggle delivery via meta-tag. Useful for deployments where headers are not available (mobile, S3, etc) or to tether the CSP policy to the client payload (i.e. policy can be updated without reconfiguring servers).\n\nThe default `contentSecurityPolicy` value is:\n\n```javascript\n  contentSecurityPolicy: {\n    'default-src': [\"'none'\"],\n    'script-src':  [\"'self'\"],\n    'font-src':    [\"'self'\"],\n    'connect-src': [\"'self'\"],\n    'img-src':     [\"'self'\"],\n    'style-src':   [\"'self'\"],\n    'media-src':   [\"'self'\"]\n  }\n```\n\nWhich is translated into:\n\n```\ndefault-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self';\n```\n\nIf a directive is omitted it will default to `'self'`. To clear a directive from the default policy above, set it to `null`. The browser will fallback to the `default-src` if a directive does not exist.\n\n### Example\n\nIf your site uses **Google Fonts**, **Mixpanel**, a custom API at **custom-api.local** and a jQuery plugin which modifies the inline `style` attribute of some elements:\n\n```javascript\n// config/environment.js\nENV.contentSecurityPolicy = {\n  // Deny everything by default\n  'default-src': \"'none'\",\n  \n  // Allow scripts from https://cdn.mxpnl.com\n  'script-src': [\"'self'\", \"https://cdn.mxpnl.com\"],\n  \n  // Allow fonts to be loaded from http://fonts.gstatic.com\n  'font-src': [\"'self'\", \"http://fonts.gstatic.com\"],\n  \n  // Allow data (ajax/websocket) from api.mixpanel.com and custom-api.local\n  'connect-src': [\"'self'\", \"https://api.mixpanel.com\", \"http://custom-api.local\"],\n  \n  // Allow images from the origin itself (i.e. current domain)\n  'img-src': \"'self'\",\n  \n  // Allow inline styles and loaded CSS from http://fonts.googleapis.com\n  'style-src': [\"'self'\", \"'unsafe-inline'\", \"http://fonts.googleapis.com\"],\n  \n  // `media-src` will be omitted from policy\n  // Browser will fallback to default-src for media resources (which is to deny, see above).\n  'media-src': null\n}\n```\n\n*Please note*:\n+ When running `ember serve` with live reload enabled, we also add the `liveReloadPort` to\n  the `connect-src` and `script-src` whitelists.\n+ Browser support for CSP varies between browsers, for example the meta-tag delivery method is only available\n  in newer browsers. See the resources below.\n+ The Internet Explorer variant of the header (prefixed with `X-`) is automatically added.\n+ When setting the values on `contentSecurityPolicy` object to 'self', 'none', 'unsafe-inline' or 'unsafe-eval', \n  you must include the single quote as shown in the default value above.\n\n## Resources\n\n* http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/\n* http://content-security-policy.com/\n* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Using_Content_Security_Policy\n* http://caniuse.com/contentsecuritypolicy\n* http://caniuse.com/contentsecuritypolicy2\n","maintainers":[{"name":"rwjblue","email":"robert.w.jackson@me.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-01-18T21:43:27.781Z","created":"2014-09-21T02:16:59.827Z","0.1.0":"2014-09-21T02:16:59.827Z","0.1.1":"2014-09-22T17:08:20.551Z","0.1.2":"2014-09-29T17:30:56.831Z","0.1.3":"2014-09-30T12:30:39.219Z","0.1.4":"2014-10-03T12:02:29.808Z","0.2.0":"2014-10-04T21:02:16.507Z","0.2.1":"2014-10-06T21:12:09.191Z","0.3.0":"2014-10-13T22:05:26.755Z","0.4.0":"2015-03-13T01:31:07.636Z","0.5.0":"2016-01-18T21:43:27.781Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-content-security-policy#readme","keywords":["ember-addon"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-content-security-policy.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-content-security-policy/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"prule":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"DDTAW02DM3LIN06Q129YA1EVW\""}
