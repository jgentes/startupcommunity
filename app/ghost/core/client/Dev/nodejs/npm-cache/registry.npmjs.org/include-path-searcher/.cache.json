Returns the full path of the first file found,\nor throws an error if none found. For example:\n\n```js\nincludePathSearcher.findFileSync('foo.txt', ['dir1', 'dir2'])\n```\n\nThis returns either `'dir1/foo.txt'` or `'dir2/foo.txt'`. If `foo.txt` does\nnot exist in either directory, it throws an error.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"joliss","email":"joliss42@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-03-01T21:57:12.568Z","created":"2014-03-01T21:57:12.568Z","0.1.0":"2014-03-01T21:57:12.568Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/joliss/include-path-searcher","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/joliss/include-path-searcher"},"author":{"name":"Jo Liss","email":"joliss42@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/joliss/include-path-searcher/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"7QCRUZTQQXEDSU01JIIOHU3WR\""}
