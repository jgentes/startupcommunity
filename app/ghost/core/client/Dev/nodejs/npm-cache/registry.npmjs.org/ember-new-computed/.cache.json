ember-new-computed\n\nThis addon allows usage of the new Ember Computed syntax as described in\n[emberjs/rfcs#11](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/11) in older versions of Ember.\n\nFor versions prior to 1.12.0-beta.1 this addon will allow usage of the new syntax by polyfilling\nbut as of Ember 1.12.0-beta.1 a polyfill is not needed and the internal implementation of\n`Ember.computed` is used.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nimport Ember from 'ember';\nimport computed from 'ember-new-computed';\n\nexport default Ember.Object({\n  first: null,\n  last: null,\n  name: computed('first', 'last', {\n    get: function() {\n      return this.get('first') + ' ' + this.get('last');\n    },\n    set: function(key, value) {\n      var [ first, last ] = value.split(' ');\n\n      this.set('first', first);\n      this.set('last', last);\n    }\n  }),\n  // All `Ember.computed` helpers exists as well\n  fullName: computed.reads('name')\n});\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n* `git clone` this repository\n* `npm install`\n* `bower install`\n\n## Running\n\n* `ember server`\n* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.\n\n## Running Tests\n\n* `ember test`\n* `ember test --server`\n\n## Building\n\n* `ember build`\n\nFor more information on using ember-cli, visit
