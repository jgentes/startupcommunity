Ember Suave\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dockyard/ember-suave.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dockyard/ember-suave)\n\nEnsures super stylish code by enforcing the DockYard JavaScript and\nEmber style guide rules.\n\n![suave](http://i.imgur.com/zM1X686.gif)\n\n* [JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/dockyard/styleguides/blob/master/engineering/javascript.md)\n* [Ember Style Guide](https://github.com/dockyard/styleguides/blob/master/engineering/ember.md)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nember install ember-suave\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n`ember-suave` is used as a JSCS preset, and can be enabled by adding a `preset` to your `.jscsrc` file.\n\n```\n{\n  \"preset\": \"ember-suave\"\n}\n```\n\n`ember-suave` integrates well with ember-cli, but can also be used as a standalone JSCS preset. This allows custom\neditor integration, and non-ember-cli projects to utilize our curated set of rules.\n\nWhen used from within ember-cli, your test suite will automatically fail if any of the rules are broken.\n\n## JSCS Rules\n\n### Default Rules\n\n`ember-suave` comes preconfigured with DockYard-curated [JSCS rules](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-suave/blob/master/lib/jscsrc.json)\nso that all you need to do is install the addon and start writing stylish code.\n\n### Customization\n\nIf `ember-suave` isn't suave enough for you and you'd like to override\ncertain rules, simply add your own rules to `.jscsrc` at the root of\nyour Ember CLI project. Those rules will take precedence over the ones in the\ndefault preset.\n\nYou can specify any of the [rules](http://jscs.info/rules.html) that are\nbuilt into JSCS, provide your own custom ones, or even override the ones we\nhave enabled by default.\n\nTo disable a rule, set its value to `null`.\n\n```json\n// .jscsrc\n{\n  \"preset\": \"ember-suave\",\n  \"additionalRules\": [\"./lib/rules/*.js\"],\n  \"myAwesomeCustomRule\": true,\n  \"disallowDanglingUnderscores\": true,\n  \"disallowEmptyBlocks\": null\n}\n```\n\n## Development\n\n* `git clone` this repository\n* `npm install`\n\n## Running Tests\n\n* `npm test`\n\n## Versioning\n\nThis library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).\n\n## Legal\n\n[DockYard](http://dockyard.com/ember-consulting), Inc &copy; 2015\n\n[@dockyard](http://twitter.com/dockyard)\n\n[Licensed under the MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"edeblois","email":"edeblois@gmail.com"},{"name":"rwjblue","email":"me@rwjblue.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-11-20T17:05:05.232Z","created":"2015-04-20T18:55:09.565Z","0.1.0":"2015-04-20T18:55:09.565Z","0.1.1":"2015-04-21T00:56:39.309Z","0.1.2":"2015-04-21T14:06:25.154Z","0.1.3":"2015-04-24T17:52:13.215Z","0.1.4":"2015-04-25T12:44:01.387Z","0.1.5":"2015-04-25T17:03:15.663Z","0.1.6":"2015-04-26T14:52:59.155Z","0.1.7":"2015-04-26T21:05:17.671Z","0.1.8":"2015-04-29T17:37:28.350Z","0.1.9":"2015-05-11T13:23:32.312Z","0.1.10":"2015-06-09T13:14:48.212Z","0.1.11":"2015-06-09T14:14:55.867Z","0.1.12":"2015-07-16T02:44:39.638Z","1.0.0":"2015-08-08T21:47:53.565Z","1.1.0":"2015-09-11T21:37:02.512Z","1.2.0":"2015-10-15T14:41:20.443Z","1.2.1":"2015-10-20T15:38:42.975Z","1.2.2":"2015-10-23T02:40:32.119Z","1.2.3":"2015-11-20T17:05:05.232Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-suave","keywords":["ember-addon","jscs-preset","preset"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/dockyard/ember-suave.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dockyard/ember-suave/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"280ZZEYMMMFJ2QEBI7895PEKS\""}
