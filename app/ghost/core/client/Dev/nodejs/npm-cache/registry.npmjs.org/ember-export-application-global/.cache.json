ember-export-application-global\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global)\n[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/ember-cli/ember-export-application-global#info=devDependencies)\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-export-application-global.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ember-export-application-global)\n\nSets `window.MyAppName` up as the application instance upon boot.\n\nBy default this is only done when not running in production mode, but you can fully\ncontrol when it is executed by including `exportApplicationGlobal` in your `config/environment.js`\nwith `true` if you want the global exported, or `false` if you do not.\n\n## Example Configuration\n\n```javascript\n// config/environment.js\n\nmodule.exports = function(environment) {\n  var ENV = {\n    // other configuration\n    exportApplicationGlobal: ['staging', 'production'].indexOf(environment) === -1\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nember install:addon ember-export-application-global\n# or for ember-cli < 0.1.5\nnpm install --save-dev ember-export-application-global\n```\n\n## Available Configuration\n\n* `exportApplicationGlobal` - Specify if you want the global to be exported.\n  A `true` will export global as the application name, but a string will export\n  is as that string.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember addon.\n\n### Installation\n\n* `git clone` this repository\n* `npm install`\n* `bower install`\n\n### Running\n\n* `ember server`\n* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.\n\n### Running Tests\n\n* `ember test`\n* `ember test --server`\n\n### Building\n\n* `ember build`\n\nFor more information on using ember-cli, visit
