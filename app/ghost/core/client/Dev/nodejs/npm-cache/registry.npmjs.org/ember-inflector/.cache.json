Ember Inflector [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/ember-inflector.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/ember-inflector)\n\nEmber Inflector is a library for inflecting words between plural and singular forms. Ember Inflector aims to be compatible with [ActiveSupport::Inflector](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Inflector.html) from Ruby on Rails, including the ability to add your own inflections in your app.\n\n## Installation\n\nEmber CLI/NPM:\n\n```\nnpm install --save ember-inflector\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAll methods are always available from `Ember.Inflector`, but in Ember CLI, you can always `import` instead:\n\n```javascript\nimport Inflector from 'ember-inflector';\nimport {singularize, pluralize} from 'ember-inflector';\n\nInflector.inflector.singularize(\"tacos\"); // taco\nInflector.inflector.pluralize(\"taco\"); // tacos\n\nsingularize(\"tacos\"); // taco\npluralize(\"taco\"); // tacos\n\n// or if not using Ember CLI/ES6\nEmber.Inflector.inflector.pluralize(\"taco\"); // tacos\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"fivetanley","email":"stanley@stan.li"},{"name":"stefanpenner","email":"stefan.penner@gmail.com"},{"name":"ofbriggs","email":"ofbriggs@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-12-08T16:05:31.832Z","created":"2014-12-02T15:23:20.540Z","1.3.0":"2014-12-02T15:23:20.540Z","1.3.1":"2014-12-02T16:18:25.296Z","1.5.0":"2015-03-23T22:27:21.409Z","1.5.1":"2015-03-25T18:16:30.762Z","1.6.0":"2015-03-25T19:00:45.443Z","1.6.1":"2015-03-27T18:41:50.372Z","1.6.2":"2015-05-04T17:51:00.812Z","1.7.0":"2015-07-13T00:31:42.531Z","1.9.0":"2015-08-01T14:30:36.907Z","1.9.1":"2015-08-16T03:32:29.769Z","1.9.2":"2015-09-04T16:02:00.728Z","1.9.3":"2015-09-16T00:40:01.925Z","1.9.4":"2015-12-08T16:05:31.832Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","keywords":["ember-addon"],"author":{"name":"Stefan Penner, Manuel Wiedenmann and Trace Wax"},"license":"MIT","homepage":"https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-inflector#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-inflector.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-inflector/issues"},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"93B9WJVJGV0NOXFV9TC500VB0\""}
