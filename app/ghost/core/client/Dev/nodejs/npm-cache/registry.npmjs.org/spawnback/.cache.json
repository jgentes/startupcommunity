The callback receives three paramaters: an error object, stdout as a string, and stderr as a string.\n\n### spawnback( command, [args], [options], callback )\n\n* `command` String: The command to run.\n* `args` Array: List of string arguments.\n* `options` Object: See the [node API docs](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) for full details on which options are supported.\n* `callback` function( error, stdout, stderr ): A callback to invoke when the child process has ended and all stdio streams have terminated.\n* return: [`ChildProcess`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process) instance.\n\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2014 Scott González.
