Ember CLI Mirage\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage)\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-cli-mirage.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ember-cli-mirage)\n[![Ember Observer Score](http://emberobserver.com/badges/ember-cli-mirage.svg)](http://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-cli-mirage)\n\nA client-side server to develop, test and prototype your Ember CLI app.\n\n<http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/>\n\n----\n\nAre you tired of\n\n- Writing one set of mocks for your tests, and another for development?\n- Wiring up tests for each of your apps manually, from scratch?\n- Changing lots of files/tests when your API changes?\n\nEmber CLI Mirage may be for you! It lets you create a client-side server using [Pretender](https://github.com/trek/pretender) to help you develop and test your app. By default, it only runs if you're not in production and if you're not proxying to an explicit API server via `ember serve --proxy`.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nember install ember-cli-mirage  # install:addon for Ember CLI < 0.2.3\n```\n### Requirements\n\nIf you are using a version of PhantomJS before 2.0, ensure you have [ember-cli-es5-shim](https://github.com/pixelhandler/ember-cli-es5-shim) installed in your app because Mirage uses `.bind`.\n\n## Updating\n\nThis project is new and the API is subject to change. When updating your project to a newer version of Ember CLI Mirage, please consult [the changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) for any update notes.\n\n## Getting started\n\nCheck out the [Docs](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/docs/latest/)!\n\n## Support\n\nHaving trouble? Open an issue!\n","maintainers":[{"name":"samselikoff","email":"sam.selikoff@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-01-16T22:54:25.847Z","created":"2015-02-28T17:36:35.692Z","0.0.19":"2015-02-28T17:36:35.692Z","0.0.21":"2015-03-04T02:18:28.492Z","0.0.22":"2015-03-08T21:38:00.014Z","0.0.23":"2015-03-14T03:03:52.487Z","0.0.24":"2015-04-02T13:04:35.725Z","0.0.25":"2015-04-17T18:44:59.128Z","0.0.26":"2015-04-17T19:40:17.668Z","0.0.27":"2015-04-25T02:34:15.296Z","0.0.28":"2015-05-16T22:31:01.212Z","0.0.29":"2015-05-20T20:17:14.424Z","0.1.0":"2015-06-01T12:35:39.666Z","0.1.1":"2015-06-01T14:40:42.793Z","0.1.2":"2015-06-01T22:26:02.998Z","0.1.3":"2015-06-10T15:55:05.852Z","0.1.4":"2015-06-10T16:12:19.819Z","0.1.5":"2015-06-22T19:56:51.176Z","0.1.6":"2015-07-27T11:51:02.216Z","0.1.7":"2015-08-17T15:07:26.781Z","0.1.8":"2015-08-18T02:12:49.656Z","0.1.9":"2015-10-05T12:03:33.129Z","0.1.10":"2015-10-13T18:25:14.596Z","0.1.11":"2015-10-14T12:06:44.384Z","0.2.0-beta.1":"2015-11-07T18:54:11.737Z","0.2.0-beta.2":"2016-01-15T23:09:36.219Z","0.2.0-beta.3":"2016-01-16T22:54:25.847Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage","keywords":["ember-addon","pretender","testing","prototype","server"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage.git"},"author":{"name":"Sam Selikoff"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"gregone":true,"mswanson1524":true,"neilor":true,"darrylr":true,"bmeurant":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"E1J0WK7L3VTCS89ADYVPRUSEO\""}
