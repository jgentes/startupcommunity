docs](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/)__\n\nEmber Simple Auth __supports all Ember.js versions starting with 1.12.__\n\n#  Ember Simple Auth\n\n![Logo](http://ember-simple-auth.com/images/logo.png)\n\nEmber Simple Auth is a __lightweight library for implementing authentication/\nauthorization with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) applications__. It has\nminimal requirements with respect to application structure, routes etc. With\nits pluggable strategies it __can support all kinds of authentication and\nauthorization mechanisms__.\n\n## What does it do?\n\n* it __maintains a client side session__ and synchronizes its state across\n  multiple tabs/windows of the application\n* it __authenticates the session__ against the application's own server,\n  external providers like Facebook etc.\n* it __authorizes requests__ to backend servers\n* it is __easily customizable and extensible__\n\n## How does it work?\n\nEmber Simple Auth consists of __4 main building blocks__ - the session, a\nsession store, authenticators and (optionally) authorizers.\n\nThe __session service is the main interface to the library__. It provides\n__methods for authenticating and invalidating the session__ as well as for\nsetting and reading session data.\n\nThe __session store persists the session state__ so that it survives a page\nreload. It also synchronizes the session state across multiple tabs or windows\nof the application so that e.g. a logout in one tab or window also results in a\nlogout in all other tabs or windows of the application.\n\n__Authenticators authenticate the session__. An application can leverage\nmultiple authenticators to support multiple ways of authentication such as\nsending credentials to the application's own backend server, Facebook, github\netc.\n\n__Authorizers__ use the data retrieved by an authenticator and stored in the\nsession to __generate authorization data that can be injected into outgoing\nrequests such as Ember Data requests__.\n\n## How do I use it?\n\n__Ember Simple Auth comes with a\n[dummy app](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/tree/master/tests/dummy)\nthat implementes a complete auth solution__ including authentication against\nthe application's own server as well as Facebook, authorization of Ember Data\nrequests and error handling. __Check out that dummy app for reference.__ To\nstart it, run\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:simplabs/ember-simple-auth.git\ncd ember-simple-auth\nnpm install && bower install && ember serve\n```\n\nand go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).\n\n### Installation\n\nInstalling the library is as easy as:\n\n```bash\nember install ember-simple-auth\n```\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nOnce the library is installed, __the session service can be injected wherever\nneeded in the application__. In order to e.g. display login/logout buttons\ndepending on the current session state, inject the service into the respective\ncontroller or component and __query its\n[`isAuthenticated` property](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/SessionService.html#property_isAuthenticated)\nin the template__:\n\n```js\n// app/controllers/application.js\nimport Ember from 'ember';\n\nexport default Ember.Controller.extend({\n  session: Ember.inject.service('session')\n\n  …\n});\n```\n\n```handlebars\n{{!-- app/templates/application.hbs --}}\n<div class=\"menu\">\n  …\n  {{#if session.isAuthenticated}}\n    <a {{action 'invalidateSession'}}>Logout</a>\n  {{else}}\n    {{#link-to 'login'}}Login{{/link-to}}\n  {{/if}}\n</div>\n<div class=\"main\">\n  {{outlet}}\n</div>\n```\n\nIn the `invalidateSession` action __call the\n[session service's `invalidate` method](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/SessionService.html#method_invalidate)\nto invalidate the session__ and log the user out:\n\n```js\n// app/controllers/application.js\nimport Ember from 'ember';\n\nexport default Ember.Controller.extend({\n  session: Ember.inject.service('session'),\n\n  …\n\n  actions: {\n    invalidateSession() {\n      this.get('session').invalidate();\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nFor authenticating the session, __the session service provides the\n[`authenticate` method](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/SessionService.html#method_authenticate)__\nthat takes the name of the authenticator to use as well as other arguments\ndepending on specific authenticator used. __To define an authenticator, add a\nnew file in `app/authenticators`__ and extend one of the authenticators the\nlibrary comes with, e.g.:\n\n```js\n// app/authenticators/oauth2.js\nimport OAuth2PasswordGrant from 'ember-simple-auth/authenticators/oauth2-password-grant';\n\nexport default OAuth2PasswordGrant.extend();\n```\n\nWith that authenticator and a login form like\n\n```handlebars\n{{!-- app/templates/login.hbs --}}\n<form {{action 'authenticate' on='submit'}}>\n  <div class=\"form-group\">\n    <label for=\"identification\">Login</label>\n    {{input value=identification placeholder='Enter Login' class='form-control'}}\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"form-group\">\n    <label for=\"password\">Password</label>\n    {{input value=password placeholder='Enter Password' class='form-control' type='password'}}\n  </div>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-default\">Login</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nthe __session can be authenticated with the\n[session service's `authenticate` method](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/SessionService.html#method_authenticate)__:\n\n```js\n// app/controllers/login.js\nimport Ember from 'ember';\n\nexport default Ember.Controller.extend({\n  session: Ember.inject.service('session'),\n\n  actions: {\n    authenticate() {\n      let { identification, password } = this.getProperties('identification', 'password');\n      this.get('session').authenticate('authenticator:oauth2', identification, password).catch((reason) => {\n        this.set('errorMessage', reason.error);\n      });\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n__The session service also provides the\n[`authenticationSucceeded`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/SessionService.html#event_authenticationSucceeded)\nand\n[`invalidationSucceeded`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/SessionService.html#event_invalidationSucceeded)\nevents__ that are triggered whenever the session is successfully authenticated\nor invalidated (which not only happens when the user submits the login form or\nclicks the logout button but also when the session is authenticated or\ninvalidated in another tab or window of the application). __To have these\nevents handled automatically, simply mix\n[`ApplicationRouteMixin`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/ApplicationRouteMixin.html)\ninto the application route__:\n\n```js\n// app/routes/application.js\nimport Ember from 'ember';\nimport ApplicationRouteMixin from 'ember-simple-auth/mixins/application-route-mixin';\n\nexport default Ember.Route.extend(ApplicationRouteMixin);\n```\n\nThe `ApplicationRouteMixin` automatically maps the session events to the\n[`sessionAuthenticated`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/ApplicationRouteMixin.html#method_sessionAuthenticated)\nand\n[`sessionInvalidated`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/ApplicationRouteMixin.html#method_sessionInvalidated)\nmethods it implements. The `sessionAuthenticated` method will transition to a\nconfigurable route while the `sessionInvalidated` method will reload the page\nto clear all potentially sensitive data from memory.\n\n__To make a route in the application accessible only when the session is\nauthenticated__, mix the\n[`AuthenticatedRouteMixin`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/AuthenticatedRouteMixin.html)\ninto the respective route:\n\n```js\n// app/routes/protected.js\nimport AuthenticatedRouteMixin from 'ember-simple-auth/mixins/authenticated-route-mixin';\n\nexport default Ember.Route.extend(AuthenticatedRouteMixin);\n```\n\nThis will make the route (and all of its subroutes) transition to a\nconfigurable login route when the session is not authenticated.\n\nTo prevent a route from being accessed when the session is authenticated (which\nmakes sense for login and registration routes for example), mix the\n[`UnauthenticatedRouteMixin`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/UnauthenticatedRouteMixin.html)\ninto the respective route.\n\nIn order to add authorization information to outgoing API requests the\napplication can define an authorizer. To do so, add a new file to\n`app/authorizers`, e.g.:\n\n```js\n// app/authorizers/oauth2.js\nimport OAuth2Bearer from 'ember-simple-auth/authorizers/oauth2-bearer';\n\nexport default OAuth2Bearer.extend();\n```\n\nand use that to authorize a block of code via the\n[session service's `authorize`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/SessionService.html#method_authorize)\nmethod, e.g.:\n\n```js\nthis.get('session').authorize('authorizer:oauth2', (headerName, headerValue) => {\n  const headers = {};\n  headers[headerName] = headerValue;\n  Ember.$.ajax('/secret-data', { headers });\n});\n```\n\nTo include authorization info in all Ember Data requests if the session is\nauthenticated, mix the\n[`DataAdapterMixin`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/DataAdapterMixin.html)\ninto the application adapter:\n\n```js\n// app/adapters/application.js\nimport DS from 'ember-data';\nimport DataAdapterMixin from 'ember-simple-auth/mixins/data-adapter-mixin';\n\nexport default DS.JSONAPIAdapter.extend(DataAdapterMixin, {\n  authorizer: 'authorizer:oauth2'\n});\n```\n\n## The Session Service\n\nThe session service is the main interface to the library. It defines the\n`authenticate`, `invalidate` and `authorize` methods as well as the session\nevents as shown above.\n\nIt also provides the\n__[`isAuthenticated`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/SessionService.html#property_isAuthenticated)\nas well as the\n[`data`]((http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/SessionService.html#property_data))\nproperties. The latter can be used to get and set the session data__. While the\nspecial `authenticated` section in the session data contains the data that was\nacquired by the authenticator when it authenticated the session and is\nread-only, all other session data can be written and will also remain in the\nsession after it is invalidated. It can be used to store all kinds of client\nside data that needs to be persisted and synchronized across tabs and windows,\ne.g.:\n\n```js\nthis.get('session').set('data.locale', 'de');\n```\n\n## Authenticators\n\n__Authenticators implement the concrete steps necessary to authenticate the\nsession.__ An application can leverage several authenticators for different\nkinds of authentication mechanisms (e.g. the application's own backend server,\nexternal authentication providers like Facebook etc.) while the session is only\never authenticated with one authenticator at a time. The authenticator to use\nis chosen when authentication is triggered via the name it is registered with\nin the Ember container:\n\n```js\nthis.get('session').authenticate('authenticator:some');\n```\n\nEmber Simple Auth comes with 3 authenticators:\n\n* [`OAuth2PasswordGrantAuthenticator`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/OAuth2PasswordGrantAuthenticator.html): an OAuth 2.0 authenticator that implements the _\"Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant Type\"_\n* [`DeviseAuthenticator`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/DeviseAuthenticator.html): an authenticator compatible with the popular Ruby on Rails authentication plugin [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)\n* [`ToriiAuthenticator`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/ToriiAuthenticator.html): an authenticator that wraps the [torii library](https://github.com/Vestorly/torii)\n\nTo use any of these authenticators in an application, define a new\nauthenticator in `app/authenticators`, extend if from the Ember Simple Auth\nauthenticator\n\n```js\n// app/authenticators/oauth2.js\nimport OAuth2PasswordGrant from 'ember-simple-auth/authenticators/oauth2-password-grant';\n\nexport default OAuth2PasswordGrant.extend();\n```\n\nand invoke the session service's `authenticate` method with the respective\nname, specifying more arguments as needed by the authenticator:\n\n```js\nthis.get('session').authenticate('authenticator:some', data);\n```\n\n### Implementing a custom Authenticator\n\nBesides extending one of the predefined authenticators, an application can also\nimplement fully custom authenticators. In order to do that, extend the\n[abstract base authenticator](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/BaseAuthenticator.html)\nthat Ember Simple Auth comes with and override the\n[`authenticate`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/BaseAuthenticator.html#method_authenticate),\n[`restore`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/BaseAuthenticator.html#method_restore)\nand (optionally)\n[`invalidate`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/BaseAuthenticator.html#method_invalidate)\nmethods:\n\n```js\n// app/authenticators/custom.js\nimport Base from 'ember-simple-auth/authenticators/base';\n\nexport default Base.extend({\n  restore(data) {\n    …\n  },\n  authenticate(options) {\n    …\n  },\n  invalidate(data) {\n    …\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Authorizers\n\n__Authorizers use the session data acquired by the authenticator to construct\nauthorization data__ that can be injected into outgoing network requests. As\nthe authorizer depends on the data that the authenticator acquires,\n__authorizers and authenticators have to fit together__.\n\nEmber Simple Auth comes with 2 authorizers:\n\n* [`OAuth2BearerAuthorizer`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/OAuth2BearerAuthorizer.html): an OAuth 2.0 authorizer that uses Bearer tokens\n* [`DeviseAuthorizer`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/DeviseAuthorizer.html): an authorizer compatible with the popular Ruby on Rails authentication plugin [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)\n\nTo use any of these authorizers in an application, define a new authroizer in\n`app/authorizers`, extend if from the Ember Simple Auth authorizer\n\n```js\n// app/authorizers/oauth2.js\nimport OAuth2Bearer from 'ember-simple-auth/authorizers/oauth2-bearer';\n\nexport default OAuth2Bearer.extend();\n```\n\nand invoke the session service's `authorize` method with the respective name:\n\n```js\nthis.get('session').authorize('authorizer:some', () => {\n  …\n});\n```\n\n__Unlike in previous versions of Ember Simple Auth, authorization will not\nhappen automatically for all requests the application issues anymore__ but has\nto be initiated explicitly via the service.\n\nWhen using Ember Data you can mix the `DataAdapterMixin` in the application\nadapter to automatically authorize all API requests:\n\n```js\n// app/adapters/application.js\nimport DS from 'ember-data';\nimport DataAdapterMixin from 'ember-simple-auth/mixins/data-adapter-mixin';\n\nexport default DS.JSONAPIAdapter.extend(DataAdapterMixin, {\n  authorizer: 'authorizer:some'\n});\n```\n\n### Implementing a custom Authorizer\n\nBesides extending one of the predefined authorizers, an application can also\nimplement fully custom authorizers. In order to do that, extend the\n[abstract base authorizer](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/BaseAuthorizer.html)\nthat Ember Simple Auth comes with and override the\n[`authorize`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/BaseAuthorizer.html#method_authorize)\nmethod:\n\n```js\n// app/authorizers/custom.js\nimport Base from 'ember-simple-auth/authorizers/base';\n\nexport default Base.extend({\n  authorize(sessionData, block) {\n    …\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Session Stores\n\nEmber Simple Auth __persists the session state via a session store so it\nsurvives page reloads__. There is only one store per application that can be\ndefined in `app/session-stores/application.js`:\n\n```js\n// app/session-stores/application.js\nimport Cookie from 'ember-simple-auth/session-stores/cookie';\n\nexport default Cookie.extend();\n```\n\nIf the application does not define a session store, the adaptive store which\nuses `localStorage` if that is available or a cookie if it is not, will be used\nby default. To customize the adaptive store, define a custom store in\n`app/session-stores/application.js` that extends it and overrides the\nproperties to customize.\n\n### Store Types\n\nEmber Simple Auth comes with 4 stores:\n\n#### Adaptive Store\n\n[The adaptive store](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/AdaptiveStore.html)\nstores its data in the browser's `localStorage` if that is available or in a\ncookie if it is not; __this is the default store__.\n\n#### `localStorage` Store\n\n[The `localStorage` store](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/LocalStorageStore.html)\nstores its data in the browser's `localStorage`. This is used by the adaptive\nstore if `localStorage` is available.\n\n#### Cookie Store\n\n[The Cookie store](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/CookieStore.html)\nstores its data in a cookie. This is used by the adaptive store if\n`localStorage` is not available.\n\n#### Ephemeral Store\n\n[The ephemeral store](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/EphemeralStore.html)\nstores its data in memory and thus __is not actually persistent. This store is\nmainly useful for testing.__ Also the ephemeral store cannot keep multiple tabs\nor windows in sync as tabs/windows cannot share memory.\n\n### Implementing a custom Store\n\nBesides using one of the predefined session stores, an application can also\nimplement fully custom stores. In order to do that, extend the\n[abstract base session store](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/BaseStore.html)\nthat Ember Simple Auth comes with and implement the\n[`persist`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/BaseStore.html#method_persist),\n[`restore`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/BaseStore.html#method_restore)\nand\n[`clear`](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/BaseStore.html#method_clear)\nmethods:\n\n```js\n// app/session-stores/application.js\nimport Base from 'ember-simple-auth/session-stores/base';\n\nexport default Base.extend({\n  persist() {\n    …\n  },\n\n  restore() {\n    …\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nEmber Simple Auth comes with a __set of test helpers that can be used in\nacceptance tests__:\n\n* `currentSession(app)`: returns the current session.\n* `authenticateSession(app, sessionData)`: authenticates the session; the\n  optional `sessionData` argument can be used to mock an authenticator\n  response - e.g. a token.\n* `invalidateSession(app)`: invalidates the session.\n\nThe test helpers can be imported from the the `helpers/ember-simple-auth`\nmodule in the application's namespace:\n\n```js\n// tests/acceptance/…\nimport { currentSession, authenticateSession, invalidateSession } from '<app-name>/helpers/ember-simple-auth';\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nEmber Simple Auth is configured via the `'ember-simple-auth'` section in the\napplication's `config/environment.js` file, e.g.:\n\n```js\nENV['ember-simple-auth'] = {\n  authenticationRoute: 'signin'\n};\n```\n\nSee the\n[API docs](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/Configuration.html)\nfor the available settings.\n\n## License\n\nEmber Simple Auth is developed by and &copy;\n[simplabs GmbH/Marco Otte-Witte](http://simplabs.com) and contributors.
