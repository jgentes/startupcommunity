And imports the\ndev/prod version of the es5-shim library into your vendor.js file.\n\n\n### Installation / Usage\n\nFrom within your Ember CLI application (must be >= 0.0.41), run the following:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev ember-cli-es5-shim\nember generate ember-cli-es5-shim\nbower install\n```\n\nYou can now use ES5 syntax supported by the `es5-shim` library.\n\n\n### Notes on Phantomjs and Function.bind\n\nYou may choose to use `function () {}.bind` and expect that phantomjs won't\nerror out when you execute your test runner (phantomjs does not support\nFunction.bind out of the box.\n\nPerhaps try out Function.bind with phantomjs, create a test like so, and\nexecute it with `ember test`.\n\n```javascript\nmodule('Function.bind test in phantomjs');\n\ntest('Function.bind works', function() {\n  this.result = false;\n\n  (function() {\n    return this.result = true;\n  }.bind(this))();\n\n  ok(this.result);\n  delete this.result;\n});\n```\n\n### References\n\n* [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim/)\n* more information on using ember-cli, visit [http://www.ember-cli.com/](http://www.ember-cli.com/).\n","maintainers":[{"name":"pixelhandler","email":"pixelhandler@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-01-13T19:21:43.006Z","created":"2014-12-20T09:57:21.771Z","0.1.0":"2014-12-20T09:57:21.771Z","0.1.1":"2015-06-01T18:58:49.982Z","0.2.0":"2016-01-13T19:21:43.006Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/pixelhandler/ember-cli-es5-shim","keywords":["ember-addon","ember-cli-es5-shim","ember-cli","es5","shim"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/pixelhandler/ember-cli-es5-shim.git"},"author":{"name":"Bill Heaton","email":"pixelhandler@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/pixelhandler/ember-cli-es5-shim/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"E8IDWD0DB3V4NHGZSXEFK8W5K\""}
