Like\n[async.mapSeries](https://github.com/caolan/async#mapseriesarr-iterator-callback),\nbut for promises.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save promise-map-series\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar mapSeries = require('promise-map-series')\n\nmapSeries(array, iterator[, thisArg]).then(function (newArray) {\n  ...\n})\n```\n\n* **`array`**: An array of values (should not be promises).\n\n* **`iterator`**: Function that returns a promise or a value for the new\n  array. The `iterator` will be called once for each element. If `iterator`\n  returns a promise, then `iterator` will only be called for the next element\n  once that promise is fulfilled. If the promise is rejected or `iterator`\n  throws an error, iteration will stop immediately and `mapSeries` returns a\n  rejected promise. The `iterator` function receives three arguments:\n\n    * **`item`**: The current item in the array.\n\n    * **`index`**: The current index in the array.\n\n    * **`array`**: The original `array` argument.\n\n* **`thisArg`** (optional): Value to use as `this` when executing `iterator`.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"joliss","email":"joliss42@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-11-10T00:45:03.797Z","created":"2014-02-28T23:36:18.872Z","0.1.0":"2014-02-28T23:36:18.872Z","0.2.0":"2014-03-01T13:58:55.197Z","0.2.1":"2014-12-28T20:32:27.964Z","0.2.2":"2015-11-10T00:45:03.797Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/joliss/promise-map-series#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/joliss/promise-map-series.git"},"author":{"name":"Jo Liss","email":"joliss42@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/joliss/promise-map-series/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"tehshrike":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"398CIK7DNNVMZL8UZQFU402W\""}
